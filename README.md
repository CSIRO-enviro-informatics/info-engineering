# Information Engineering

This repository collects a set of introductory and pedagogical materials related to information engineering and standards, mainly using semantic web standards and platforms. The application examples are primarily technical, scientific and geospatial. 

Standardisation of geospatial information has used many platforms, including (but not limited to)

- data dictionaries
- XML - document-style, using DTDs
- XML - data-style, using XSD
- UML with various implementations
- shapefiles
- JSON, GeoJSON
- RDFS/OWL

A lot of patterns and 'how-tos' were developed by [CSIRO](https://csiro.au) through the Solid Earth and Environment Grid initiative, still available at [SEEGrid](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/seegrid/Solid+Earth+and+Environment+GRID). 
Note that this was originally a TWiki, which was migrated to Confluence but incompletely cleaned up after the migration.

The documentation on this site is complementary to the SEEGrid resources, reflecting 10 years progress since maintenance of the SEEGrid material began to wind down. 
The focus on this site is mainly on **semantic web** tools and technologies.

## Technical details of this site

This site is maintained as a set of **markdown** files maintained in [this repository](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/info-engineering) and published through GitHub pages - standard intro below

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/info-engineering/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

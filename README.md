# Information Engineering

This repository collects a set of introductory and pedagogical materials related to information engineering and standards, primarily related to geospatial applications.

Standardisation of geospatial information has used many platforms, including (but not limited to)

- data dictionaries
- XML - using DTDs
- XML - using XSD
- UML with various implementations
- shapefiles
- RDFS/OWL

A lot of patterns and 'how-tos' were developed by [CSIRO](https://csiro.au) through the Solid Earth and Environment Grid initiative, still available at [SEEGrid](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/seegrid/Solid+Earth+and+Environment+GRID) - (originally a TWiki, partly migrated to Confluence but not really cleaned up after the migration.)

The documentation on this site is largely complementary to the SEEGrid resources, and reflect 10 years progress since maintenance of the SEEGrid material began to wind down. 

## Technical details of this site

This site is maintained as a set of **markdown** files maintained in [this repository](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/info-engineering) and published through GitHub pages - standard intro below

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/info-engineering/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
